### Background

This package provides tools for the exploration of earthquakes from the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Significant Earthquake dataset.  Data can be obtained from the NOAA at https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1.

### What is an Earthquake?

From Wikipedia, we know that an "earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling."

The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.
